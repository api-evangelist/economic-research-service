  The Economic Research Service (ERS) is a division of the United States
  Department of Agriculture (USDA) that conducts economic research and analysis
  related to agriculture, food, and rural development. ERS provides
  policymakers, stakeholders, and the public with valuable information and data
  to help inform decision-making and policy development. By studying trends,
  market dynamics, and the impacts of various policies and programs, ERS helps
  to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of agricultural and food systems,
  promote economic growth in rural communities, and enhance food security and
  nutrition for all Americans. Ultimately, the work of the Economic Research
  Service plays a critical role in supporting a sustainable and prosperous
  agricultural sector and food economy.
